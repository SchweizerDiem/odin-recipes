    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A favorite family recipe that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests. 
      Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a must! Serve over hot cooked white
      rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss 
        with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</li>

      <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the 
        chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and 
        lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the 
        chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be 
        tough.</li>
    </ol>
